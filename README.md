#  Retail Sales Analysis (SQL Project)

##  Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive retail sales analysis conducted using SQL across four relational tables: `products`, `customers`, `orders`, and `order_items`.

The objective was to extract actionable business insights from transactional retail data using advanced SQL querying, segmentation logic, and relational joins to support data-driven decision-making.

---

##  Dataset Structure

The retail database consists of:

- 100 Orders  
- 100 Customers  
- 100 Products  
- 5 Cities Represented  
- **Total Revenue: $248,226**

The schema design supports normalized relational querying and multi-table joins for advanced business intelligence extraction.

##  SQL Concepts Applied (36 Queries)

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`
- `INNER JOIN` across multiple tables
- `CASE` statements for segmentation
- Date filtering (Year & Month analysis)
- `UNION`
- Subqueries and aggregation logic
